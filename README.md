Hey! I'm Benjamin AKA Trizton951, currently studying MSc in Applied Physics and Electrics (Y) at LinkÃ¶ping Unversity, Sweden.

In my free time, I like to play around with programming, electronics and tech in general.

I can be found on Twitter as @phereu_, YouTube as trizton123, Instagram as @b3nphoto.

Currently not open to new projects as school takes up too much time, but feel free to give me a follow and we'll see what happens in the future ðŸ˜ƒ
